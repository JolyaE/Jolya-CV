  <h2>About</h2>
    <p> A high school senior with a passion for software and web development in general, 
      I dedicate much of my time and thought to advance myself in the field. In school, 
      I do the courses I can to advance myself with computers in general, including AP CS Principles and A, Graphic Design, and 
      plan to do Computer Science III, a self-paced, project-based class next year alongside the practicum-style class Graphic Design II. 
      Currently, I am working towards my AWS Cloud Practicioner Certification and the certification provided by freeCodeCamp.org. While I 
      love and dedicate my time to coding, I also find lots of joy in art and photography, and have had two pieces make it to the school's annual art show so far. 
      Though I have been and will continue to be a part of a 
      internship in sports and media with GCISD, 
      I aim to be a part of an internship for my own field specifically.
